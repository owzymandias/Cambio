## About Cambio

Cambio is a fast-paced card game where players try to achieve the lowest score by remembering card positions and strategically swapping cards. Players can use special card powers to peek at hidden cards, swap with opponents, and ultimately call "Cambio!" to end the round when they believe they have the lowest score.

## How to Play

1. Each player receives 4 cards in a 2x2 grid, face-down
2. View your two closest cards once at the start, then remember them
3. On your turn, draw from the deck or take from the discard pile
4. Swap drawn cards with your own to lower your score
5. Use special powers when discarding certain cards:
   - **7/8**: Peek at your own card
   - **9/10**: Peek at opponent's card
   - **J/Q**: Blind swap with opponent
   - **K**: Look at your own card
6. Call "Cambio!" when you think you have the lowest score
7. All other players get one final turn
8. Lowest total score wins! (Number cards = face value, J/Q = 10, K = 0, A = 1)
