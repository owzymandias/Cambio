# Tasks: Core Cambio Game Mechanics

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-core-game-mechanics/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Tests are included in this feature per project standards (Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Nuxt 4 unified structure**: `server/` for backend, `app/` for frontend
- **Database schema**: `server/database/schema/`
- **API endpoints**: `server/api/game/`
- **Services**: `server/services/game/`
- **Components**: `app/components/game/`
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/` and `tests/e2e-playwright/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-11)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6 ‚Üí US7 ‚Üí US8 ‚Üí US9)
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on core user stories (US1-US6 minimum for MVP)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (Game Creation)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Join Game)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but builds on US1
- **User Story 3 (Card Deal)**: Depends on US2 (need players to join) - Can integrate
- **User Story 4 (Turn Gameplay)**: Depends on US3 (need cards dealt) - Core gameplay
- **User Story 5 (Special Powers)**: Depends on US4 (extends turn gameplay) - Enhancement
- **User Story 6 (Cambio & Scoring)**: Depends on US4 (needs turn system) - Game completion
- **User Story 7 (AI Bots)**: Depends on US4-US6 (needs full game logic) - Can be parallel with US8-US9
- **User Story 8 (Reconnection)**: Depends on US2 (needs WebSocket system) - Independent feature
- **User Story 9 (State Retrieval)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent feature

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) SHOULD be written and FAIL before implementation
- Database schema and models before services
- Services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core UI components before integration
- Story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks except T004 (depends on T001) can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T006-T007, T008-T011, T012-T014 can each run in parallel within their groups
- **Within User Stories**:
  - Tests can run in parallel with each other
  - Models can run in parallel with each other
  - Independent UI components can be built in parallel
  - API endpoints for different actions can be built in parallel
- **Across User Stories**: Once Foundational completes:
  - US1 + US9 can start immediately in parallel
  - US2 + US8 can start after US1 in parallel
  - US3-US6 form a sequential chain (gameplay flow)
  - US7 can start once US6 completes

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 4 (Turn Gameplay)

```bash
# Tests can all run in parallel (if TDD approach):
Task T049: "Unit test for draw from deck"
Task T050: "Unit test for draw from discard"
Task T051: "Unit test for swap card logic"
Task T052: "Unit test for turn validation"

# UI components can run in parallel:
Task T062: "Create DrawPile component"
Task T063: "Create DiscardPile component"
Task T064: "Create TurnIndicator component"

# Core engine actions are sequential (build on each other)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-4 + 6)

This is the MINIMUM for a playable game:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup (database, types, validation)
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational (CRITICAL - deck, WebSocket, session management)
3. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 (Create games)
4. **Phase 4**: User Story 2 (Join games)
5. **Phase 5**: User Story 3 (Deal cards)
6. **Phase 6**: User Story 4 (Play turns)
7. **Phase 8**: User Story 6 (Cambio & scoring)
8. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Play complete 2-player games, verify all basic mechanics work
9. **Deploy/demo MVP**

**Skip for MVP**: US5 (special powers), US7 (bots), US8 (reconnection), US9 (state API)

### Incremental Delivery

After MVP, add features incrementally:

1. **MVP** (US1-4, US6): Basic playable game ‚Üí Deploy
2. **+ US5**: Special card powers ‚Üí Deploy
3. **+ US7**: AI bot opponents for solo play ‚Üí Deploy
4. **+ US8**: Reconnection handling ‚Üí Deploy
5. **+ US9**: State persistence for page refreshes ‚Üí Deploy
6. **+ Phase 12**: Polish and production hardening ‚Üí Deploy

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers:

1. **All together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (critical path)
2. **After Foundational**:
   - Developer A: US1 (Game Creation) ‚Üí US3 (Card Deal) ‚Üí US5 (Special Powers)
   - Developer B: US2 (Join Game) ‚Üí US4 (Turn Gameplay) ‚Üí US6 (Cambio)
   - Developer C: US9 (State API) ‚Üí US8 (Reconnection) ‚Üí US7 (Bots)
3. **Integration**: Merge and test all stories together
4. **All together**: Phase 12 (Polish)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, can run in parallel without conflicts
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Server-authoritative**: ALL game logic validation happens server-side, never trust client
- **Real-time first**: Use WebSocket for all game state updates, REST API only for initial requests
- **Mobile-first**: Design for touch, test on mobile devices throughout
- **Test strategy**: Focus on game rule correctness, action validation, and critical flows
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group of parallel tasks
- **Independent stories**: Each user story should be testable on its own
- **Avoid**: Cross-story dependencies that break independence, vague tasks, same-file conflicts
